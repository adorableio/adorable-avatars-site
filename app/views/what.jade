      h2 Wait, how is Adorable Avatars different?
      p While other placeholder services provide purely random images, Adorable Avatars renders a unique image based on the URL. Our service takes your request (with your identifier) and procedurally generates a <b>consistent</b> avatar, just for you.

      h2 How would I use it?
      p The simplest way is to create an image tag that points to our service (specifying your identifier!), but you can also browse to your avatar URL and save the image to your computer.
      p Already have avatars implemented in your application? Use Adorable Avatars as a fallback and get rid of those boring gray silhouettes!

      h2 Why would I use it?
      p What if you're developing a feature like member lists or profiles, but you don't have any images to use? Just give us your user's identifier and we'll give you their avatar image. That's it! Simple, right?
